# CS50-Final-Project

In my final project, I've wanted to enhanced some functionality of the Finance Problem set, because I've tried to better understand how the BA and the FE work together. I've added a couple of functionality wich the main are the two dinamic graph in the index page, created with the Chart.js library. I've also made small graphic improvements and some other minor functionality improvments like the history tab that now only shows the transactions made in the last 2 days for the sake of the page space.

Thank you very much for the amazing course.
